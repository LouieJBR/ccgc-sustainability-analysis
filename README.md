# Clean Code, Green Code

This project involves building a tool that analyzes the energy consumption of code (both frontend and backend) and provides actionable feedback for optimization. 

## Aim

The aim of this program is to promote green coding practices by minimizing resource usage, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of software applications.

The analyzer will profile code to measure its resource consumption, such as CPU, memory, and network usage, and provide recommendations to refactor code for better energy efficiency. The tool can be used by developers during the coding process to improve the efficiency of their applications.
